### 🧠 DSA Problem — 1903. Largest Odd Number in String

#### 🔸 Problem Summary  
Given a numeric string, find the **largest-valued odd-number substring** that can be formed by removing some suffix characters.

---

#### 🔸 Approach Used
- Traverse the string from **right to left**
- Check each digit:
  - If the digit is **odd**, return the substring from index `0` to that position
- If no odd digit is found, return an empty string

---

#### 🔸 Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (excluding output string)
