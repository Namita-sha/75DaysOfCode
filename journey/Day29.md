# Day 29 — 22nd Dec 2025

## 🧠 DSA Progress — Arrays & Hashing Focus

### 🔸 Problems Solved / Revised

1️⃣ **Longest Subarray with Given Sum K (Positives)**  
- Used sliding window technique  
- Efficient O(n) solution for positive numbers

2️⃣ **Longest Subarray with Sum K (Positives + Negatives)**  
- Used prefix sum + hashmap  
- Learned why sliding window fails with negatives

3️⃣ **Find the Union of Two Arrays**  
- Two-pointer / set-based approach  
- Handled duplicates correctly

4️⃣ **Two Sum**  
- HashMap-based optimal solution  
- Time: O(n), Space: O(n)

5️⃣ **Sort an Array of 0s, 1s and 2s**  
- Dutch National Flag Algorithm  
- In-place, O(n) time, O(1) space

6️⃣ **Majority Element (> n/2 times)**  
- Used Moore’s Voting Algorithm  
- Space-optimized linear solution

7️⃣ **Kadane’s Algorithm — Maximum Subarray Sum**  
- Tracked running sum and global maximum  
- Core array optimization pattern

8️⃣ **Print Subarray with Maximum Sum (Extended Kadane)**  
- Stored start and end indices  
- Converted theory into practical output
