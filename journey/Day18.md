## 🧠 DSA Progress — String Problems Day

### 🔸 Problems Solved

**1️⃣ Largest Odd Number in a String** (Easy)  
- Traversed from right to left to find first odd digit  
- Returned substring up to that position  
- Time: O(n), Space: O(1)  
📌 Strength: String scanning + digit checks

**2️⃣ Longest Common Prefix** (Easy)  
- Compared characters of all strings index by index  
- Stopped when mismatch occurred  
- Time: O(n * m) with n strings and m prefix length  
📌 Classic interview question for string pattern matching

**3️⃣ Isomorphic Strings** (Easy — Revision)  
- Used two maps to preserve bijection  
- Ensured consistent mapping in both directions  
📌 Strengthened mapping problems understanding

**4️⃣ Check if One String is Rotation of Another** (Medium)  
- Used the `s1 + s1` trick  
- Checked if `s2` is a substring of doubled string  
- Simple yet elegant O(n) solution  
📌 Very common in product company interviews (Amazon, Microsoft)

**5️⃣ Check if Two Strings Are Anagrams** (Easy)  
- Frequency map comparisons  
- Sorting approach also valid  
📌 Reinforced hashing + character frequency logic
