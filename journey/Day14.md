# Day 14 — 8th Dec 2025

## 🧠 DSA Progress

### 🔸 Problem Solved  
**Implement Stack using Queues**  
- Simulated a **Stack (LIFO)** using **Queue (FIFO)** operations
- Used **push-costly approach**:
  - Insert at back, then rotate queue to bring latest element to front
- Thus, **front of queue = top of stack*

## 🏛️ CS Fundamentals

### 🔸 Operating System: Threads  
- A thread is the **smallest unit of CPU execution**  
- Multiple threads can run inside a **single process**  
- Shared memory → faster communication  
- Useful for concurrency + parallelism

📌 Interview takeaway:  
“Thread = lightweight process with shared resources”

## 🧩 System Design

### 🔸 What is a Cache?  
- Fast memory layer storing **frequently accessed data**  
- Reduces response latency + database load  
- Found in CPU, databases, browsers, CDNs  
- Cache invalidation policies:
  - LRU (Least Recently Used)
  - LFU (Least Frequently Used)
  - FIFO (First In First Out)

### 🔸 What is Thrashing?
- Happens when system spends **more time swapping pages**  
  than executing actual processes  
- Caused by insufficient RAM + too many active processes  
- Performance collapses due to continuous paging
