# Day 17 — 11th Dec 2025

## 🧠 DSA Progress

### 🔸 Problem Solved  
**205. Isomorphic Strings**  
- Learned how to check if two strings follow the **same mapping pattern**  
- Used two hash maps:
  - `s → t` mapping  
  - `t → s` reverse mapping  
- Ensured no two characters map to the same character  
- Time Complexity: O(n), Space: O(1)

## 💻 Development Progress

### 🔸 AI Resume Analyzer — Major Work Today
Spent most of the day fixing errors & stabilizing logic.

**What was done:**
- Debugged multiple JS + backend integration issues  
- Fixed fetch() / async communication bugs  
- Cleaned prompt structure  
- Error-handling for API responses  
- Improved UI consistency  
- Tested multiple resume formats (PDF/Text)  
- Ensured input → processing → output cycle works cleanly

## 🏛️ CS Fundamentals

### 🔸 Operating System — Deep Revision
Revisited advanced OS concepts:
- Process & thread lifecycle  
- Scheduling algorithms in depth (FCFS, SJF, RR, Priority)  
- Deadlock conditions + prevention  
- Memory management: Paging, Segmentation, TLB  
- Thrashing detailed analysis  
- Page replacement algorithms (FIFO, LRU, Optimal)
