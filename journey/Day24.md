## 🧠 DSA Progress

### 🔸 Problem Solved  
**Single Element in a Sorted Array**

#### 🔸 Problem Summary  
Given a **sorted array** where every element appears **exactly twice except one**, find the element that appears only once.  
The solution must run in **O(log n) time** and **O(1) space**.

---

#### 🔸 Approach Used — Binary Search
- Used the **index parity property** of a sorted array:
  - Before the single element:
    - First occurrence at even index
    - Second occurrence at odd index
  - After the single element, this pattern breaks
- Applied binary search to identify where the pattern changes

---

#### 🔸 Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

---

#### 🔸 Pattern Used
- Binary Search on Answer
- Index parity pattern
