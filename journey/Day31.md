## 🧠 DSA Progress

### 🔸 Problem Solved  
**53. Maximum Subarray**

---

### 🔸 Problem Summary  
Given an integer array, find the **contiguous subarray** with the **maximum sum** and return that sum.

---

### 🔸 Approach Used — Kadane’s Algorithm
- Maintained a running sum of elements
- If the running sum becomes negative, reset it to `0`
- Tracked the maximum sum encountered at each step

---

### 🔸 Key Logic
- Add current element to `sum`
- Update `maxi` if `sum` becomes larger
- If `sum < 0`, reset `sum` to `0`
- Final `maxi` stores the maximum subarray sum

---

### 🔸 Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

---

### 🔸 Pattern Used
- Kadane’s Algorithm
- Greedy
- Prefix sum optimization

📌 Very important medium-level interview problem  
📌 Frequently asked in FAANG & product-based companies
