# Day 7 — !st Dec 2025

## 🧠 DSA Progress

### 🔸 Problem Solved  
**189. Rotate Array**  
- Learned how to rotate an array by `k` steps  
- Understood the reverse-based optimal approach  
  1. Reverse entire array  
  2. Reverse first `k` elements  
  3. Reverse remaining `n-k` elements  
- Practiced handling large `k` using `k = k % n`  
- Time complexity: O(n), Space: O(1)

### 🔸 Concepts Revised  
- Reverse operations on subarrays  
- Modulo usage to avoid unnecessary rotations
